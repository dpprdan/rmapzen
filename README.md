## Introduction

NOTE: [Mapzen has shut down](https://www.mapzen.com/blog/shutdown/).
However, the rmapzen package can be used with [other PELIAS
providers](https://www.mapzen.com/blog/migration/). The specific hosting
service can be set up with `mz_set_host`. For known providers, `rmapzen`
includes pre-configured API set up functions:

-   `mz_set_search_host_geocode.earth` to set up
    [geocode.earth](https://geocode.earth/) as a search (includes
    geocoding, autocomplete, etc) provider
-   `mz_set_search_host_nyc_geosearch()` to set up [GeoSearch from NYC
    Planning Labs](https://geosearch.planninglabs.nyc/) (currently in
    beta) as a search provider.
-   `mz_set_tile_host_nextzen` to set up
    [Nextzen](https://www.nextzen.org/) as a vector tile provider

If you know of an API that uses PELIAS that is not included here, [let
me know](https://github.com/tarakc02/rmapzen/issues/new).
